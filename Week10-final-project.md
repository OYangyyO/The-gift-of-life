### Background and Inspiration

In Chinese traditional culture, the concept of “keeping the body intact as a gift from one’s parents” is deeply rooted, creating a significant cultural barrier to organ donation. However, organ donation transcends the physical realm, symbolizing the continuation of life and embodying profound compassion and altruism.

**The Gift of Life** was conceived to bridge the gap between the cultural and emotional complexities surrounding organ donation. By leveraging technology and art, this project creates a space where donors, recipients, and their families can connect on a deeply emotional and spiritual level, making the act of organ donation more meaningful and widely accepted.

## Hardware

In our project, several components were replaced

Icon 1: The ESP32 was burned due to improper operation during the soldering process, and it was replaced with an UNO board.

Icon 2: The amplifier board had too much power, resulting in excessively loud vibrations, so it was replaced with a 10w amplifier board.

Icon 3: The heart rate sensor we purchased was incompatible with the ESP32, causing data issues, so it was replaced with another model of heart rate senor.

Icon 4: Using a 220V power switch was unsafe. Following the teacher's advice, it was replaced with a 5V 2A plug and a 24V 5A plug.

## Project Overview

The design inspiration for **Gift of Life** originates from the stainless steel instruments found on surgical operating tables, aiming to transform people's traditional thinking and inherent perceptions of organ donation.

At the center of the installation is a stainless steel tray that rises in a reverent posture, symbolizing an act of "offering" or "support".   The stainless steel tray oscillates with water ripples synchronized to the heartbeat of the recipient, reflecting the fundamental essence of organ donation in giving life.   The gleaming stainless steel embodies the duality of science and humanity: the cold, precise medical intervention coexisting with the warm, altruistic dedication.

The choice of materials and design is directly linked to the project's core theme.   The "tray" becomes more than just an object;   it is a metaphorical bridge connecting life and death, enabling organs to achieve the grand mission of circulation, transition, and ultimately transcendence.   It narrates the delicate balance between human vulnerability and the immense power of sacrifice.

By borrowing the visual language of the operating room, the installation evokes the solemnity and sanctity of organ transplantation.   The upward, offering-like structural posture conveys messages of hope, dedication, and the infinite potential of life.

The design challenges viewers to reconsider organ donation not as a clinical procedure, but as a profound act of human connection and regeneration.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

The project consists of three interconnected parts: Cycle, Transformed, and Transcendence. These components combine sensory interaction with symbolic representation to explore the journey of life, death, and renewal through organ donation.

1.**Cycle**
Core Concept: Family members of the donor can hear the sound of the donor’s heart beating within the chest of the recipient.
The heartbeat becomes the “rhythm of life,” signifying the donor’s continued existence in another. Real-time heart rate data from the recipient is transformed into an audible heartbeat, fostering an intimate connection between the family and the ongoing life of the donor.

2.**Transformed**
Core Concept: Heart rate data is visualized as rippling water waves, symbolizing the transfer and continuation of life.
The ripples represent the enduring impact of a life given, expanding into a new realm of existence. Using real-time data and dynamic projection, the waves create an interactive visual experience, connecting the physical and spiritual aspects of life.

3.**Transcendence**
Core Concept: Traditional religious Buddhist bell accompany the heartbeat, merging its rhythm with spiritual soundscapes.
These sounds evoke the idea of life’s elevation, transforming grief into spiritual solace. The ritualistic elements aim to provide emotional healing for the donor’s family and elevate the act of donation to a spiritual journey.

### Design Philosophy
In this project, we integrated multiple sensory experiences: visualizing heart rate as water waves, combining the vibration of a stainless-steel tray with the  sound of a traditional Buddhist bell, and connecting the donor and recipient through a tactile touchpad interface. By blending traditional culture with modern technology, we aimed to break conventional perceptions and elevate organ donation from a medical act to a spiritual experience.

### Reflections
We chose organ donation as our central theme—a topic rich with emotional tension and profound significance. This choice challenged us to explore how music could convey the subtleties of deep emotions. During the early stages of development, we realized that expressing such profound sentiments would require not only creativity but also a deep understanding and respect, especially when addressing the stories of donors and their families.

This project prompted us to reflect on the role of art—not just as a means of expression but also as a form of communication. Through this installation, we hope to enable audiences to feel the continuation of life and the selflessness of the act of giving, conveyed through the universal language of music.

### Future Directions


In the future, we plan to further optimize the structural design of the installation, achieving greater harmony between aesthetics and functionality. Specifically, we will upgrade the primary material from the current 3D-printed components to stainless steel. This change will not only enhance the overall texture and visual impact of the model but also better reflect the project’s themes, conveying a sense of solemnity and permanence that aligns with the fusion of technology and humanity.

Additionally, we aim to integrate the currently dispersed sensors seamlessly into the structure. By embedding the sensors directly within the installation, we can create a smoother, more cohesive interactive experience. This streamlined approach will simplify the external appearance of the device, making it more elegant and immersive for the audience.

We also plan to explore additional sensory experiences to enrich audience interaction. For example, incorporating scent design to evoke memory or using temperature changes to simulate the vitality of a heartbeat. These new elements will add depth and dimensionality to the installation, allowing audiences to engage with the emotional and symbolic layers of organ donation in a more profound and meaningful way.
